# School District Analysis
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The Overview
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 We helped our friend Maria, by analyzing data from different schools to see if there were any trends in student funding 
and the students' standardized test scores. Maria turned the finished analysis to her School Board, however they notified 
her that they believe one of the Excel files that we used to get data from "... shows evidence of academic dishonesty... 
although the school board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty." With that in mind, Maria has asked us 
to help again by aggregating the data so that the "altered" data points are replaced with the special floating-point value,
NaN, while keeping the integrity of the rest of the dataset. Once the NaNs are in place, Maria would like the first analysis
to be repeated with the new limitation, so that it can be turned in to the school board again.

## Results
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 For the results of this exercise, the original analysis and the second analysis had similar outcomes. Both the original 
 analysis and the second analysis dealt with the same large dataset. In the second analysis, we were asked to remove the 
 math and reading scores for the 9th graders at Thomas high school which only made up a very small portion of the total 
 dataset. Therefore, by removing just a few data points it was not enough to significantly skew the results. 
 Below is a picture of the results for the original data set:

In this picture below, we have the results from the second analysis that has the math and reading scores for the 9th 
graders at Thomas high school removed from the same dataset:
