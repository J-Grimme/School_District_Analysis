# School District Analysis
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The Overview
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 We helped our friend Maria, by analyzing data from different schools to see if there were any trends in student funding 
and the students' standardized test scores. Maria turned the finished analysis to her School Board, however they notified 
her that they believe one of the Excel files that we used to get data from "... shows evidence of academic dishonesty... 
although the school board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty." With that in mind, Maria has asked us 
to help again by aggregating the data so that the "altered" data points are replaced with the special floating-point value,
NaN, while keeping the integrity of the rest of the dataset. Once the NaNs are in place, Maria would like the first analysis
to be repeated with the new limitation, so that it can be turned in to the school board again.
